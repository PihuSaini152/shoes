ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND ALLBIRDS FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND ALLBIRDS AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ALLBIRDS AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.</h2>
        <h2>YOU AND ALLBIRDS EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING DISPUTES AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO DELAY ADJUDICATION OF EITHER PARTY’S CLAIMS.</h2>
<h2>FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW, IN SECTION 13(j), IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</h2>
<h3>a Claims This Section Applies To. This Section 13 applies to all Claims between you and Allbirds. A “Claim” is any dispute, claim, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed in Section 13(c), below) between you and Allbirds, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, for which either party wishes to seek legal recourse and that arises from or relates to these Terms or the Platform, including any claims related to the use or operation of the Platform, the purchase of any products or services made available through the Platform, all privacy or data security claims, and all claims related to the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Section or any portion of it.</h3>
<h3>b Informal Dispute Resolution Before Arbitration. If you believe you have a Claim against Allbirds or if Allbirds believes it has a Claim against you, you and Allbirds will first attempt to resolve the Claim informally to try to resolve the Claim more quickly and reduce costs for both parties. You and Allbirds will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution of any Claim for 45 days (“Informal Resolution Period”), from the day either party receives a written notice of a dispute from the other party that satisfies the requirements of this Section 13(b) (a “Claimant Notice”). The Informal Resolution Period is designed to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. The Informal Resolution Period may be extended by the parties’ mutual written agreement.</h3>
<h3>You must send any Claimant Notice to Allbirds by certified mail, addressed to Allbirds, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1875 Mission St Ste 103, San Francisco, CA 94103 or by email to legal@allbirds.com. Allbirds will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to Allbirds. The party sending a Claimant Notice (the “Claimant”) will ensure it includes (i) the Claimant’s name, address, email address, and telephone number; (ii) a description of the nature of and basis for the Claim, including the date(s) on which the Claim arose and the facts on which the Claim is based; (iii) the specific relief sought; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the Claimant themselves (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Claimant Notice.</h3>
