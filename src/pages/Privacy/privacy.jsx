        <h3>We share information collected through the Services with the following categories of parties</h3>
        <h3>a. Vendors and Service Providers. We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers. The types of service providers to whom we entrust personal information include service providers for: (i) order fulfillment and warehousing; (ii) web hosting, analytics and related services; (iii) payment processing, fraud protection, and credit risk reduction; (iv) customer service activities such as inquiries and shipping; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Services. Allbirds’ policy is to execute appropriate contracts with service providers that prohibit them from using or sharing personal information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements, and this Privacy Policy.</h3>
        <h3>b. Business Partners. Allbirds may share personal information with its business partners and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service that you have requested. Allbirds may also provide personal information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Allbirds.</h3>
         <h3>c. Marketing. Allbirds may allow third party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities on our Services (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected personal information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with third party advertising partners. Advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other companies) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Allbirds related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising”. We may allow access to other data collected by the Service to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.</h3>  
         <h3>d. Professional Advisors: We share personal data with our legal, financial, insurance and other advisors in connection with corporate transactions or in connection with the management of all or part of our business or operations.</h3>
         <h3>e. Legal Disclosure / Law Enforcement. We may access, preserve and disclose your personal information, other account information and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate: (i) to comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as, a court order or subpoena; (ii) to respond to your requests; (iii) to protect yours, ours or others’ rights, property or safety; (iv) to enforce Allbirds policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Allbirds; (vi) to comply with records retention policies; (vii) when we believe access, preservation, or disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (viii) if we, in good faith, believe that access, preservation, or disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order to allow them to identify users in connection with their investigation of unauthorized activities.</h3>

    <h3>c. “Do Not Track.” Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not override these settings or options. However, in order to access certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Services, you may be required to provide us with certain information, including some types of personally identifying information. If you do not wish to provide such information through the Service or if you opt to utilize the aforementioned privacy features of your computer system or web browser, you may be unable to obtain certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Site.</h3>
    <h3>d. Cookies and Similar Technologies. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs may not be effective on mobile interfaces. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt-out of certain mobile advertisements via their device settings. The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, www.youronlinechoices.eu/ or www.youradchoices.ca/, and www.aboutads.info/choices/. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link, and that link to this Privacy Policy, may have been directed to you based on anonymous nonpersonal information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</h3>
  <h3>e. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction. Where permitted by applicable law, you may inquire as to whether Allbirds is processing personal information about you, request access to personal information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of your rights under data privacy laws that apply in the country where you live. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an email to privacy@allbirds.com or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive, seek rectification, or request erasure of personal information held about you by Allbirds. Please include your full name, email address associated with your account and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in accordance with local laws. Although Allbirds will use good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which Allbirds is unable to provide access, including but not limited to where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy, in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Allbirds will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.</h3>
